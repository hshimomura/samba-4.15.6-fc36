Samba 4.15.6 packages for Fedora 36

As for April 23 2022, Samba 4.16 of Fedora 36 cannot share [homes] directory. When you connect your Samba server on Fedora 36, you will not see your home directly.
Looks Samba 4.15.x train resolve the issue, hence I created Samba 4.15.6 package based of Fedora 35 and upload it to github for record.

I know so far Fedora team will resolve the issue.
